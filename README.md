SlowCheetahify
==============

A sample project to demonstrate how to use the Xml Transforms of the Slow Cheetah tool.

Have you ever wanted to use the cool XML transforms technology of ASP.NET in a non Web project?

If so, then you need Slow Cheetah!

- Download & install the Slow Cheetah Extension via VS extensions or here: http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/69023d00-a4f9-4a34-a6cd-7e854ba318b5
- Build & Run the console app in debug mode then in release mode.
- Notice how Slow Cheetah transforms the value of the appSetting "testSetting".
